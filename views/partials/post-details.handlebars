      as an intermediary between the Model and View, handling user input,
      processing requests, and managing the flow of data. This separation of
      concerns enhances maintainability, scalability, and code reusability in
      web development. MVC promotes a clean and modular codebase, making it

      applications, as each component has a specific role and can be modified or
      extended without affecting the
