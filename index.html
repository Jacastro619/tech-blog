            MVC, which stands for Model-View-Controller, is a fundamental
            architectural pattern widely used in web development to structure
            and organize the components of a web application. It divides the
            application into three interconnected components: the Model, which
            represents the data and business logic; the View, responsible for
            presenting the user interface and rendering data to the user; and
            the Controller, which acts as an intermediary between the Model and
            View, handling user input, processing requests, and managing the
            flow of data. This separation of concerns enhances maintainability,
            scalability, and code reusability in web development. MVC promotes a
            clean and modular codebase, making it easier for developers to
            collaborate and maintain complex web applications, as each component
            has a specific role and can be modified or extended without
            affecting the
